This is the second homework assignment for Northwestern's coding bootcamp.

Included are an index.html, an assets folder containing a corresponding .css style sheet (style.css), and an images folder.

The page contains a Navbar which links to three different sections. 
The "About" section contains an image which responds to the hover pseudo class.
The "Projects" section has 4 containers, each currently holding a placeholder that links to a placeholder link.
The "contact" section links to 4 different outside profiles including email.
